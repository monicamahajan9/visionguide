 * Start the navigation loop. Always begins in scan phase: a guided
 * 4-direction look-around (ahead/right/behind/left — see
 * 09-visionguide-guided-scan-spec.md) where Claude checks each direction in
 * turn for the goal. If the goal isn't found directly, the loop falls
 * through to explore phase (walking guidance, pointed toward whichever
 * direction looked most promising) and finally to navigate phase once the
 * goal is found. SCAN_TIMEOUT_MS is an overall safety net in case a leg's
 * turn-detection never resolves.
 *
 * @param {HTMLVideoElement} videoEl      - Live camera feed element
 * @param {React.MutableRefObject} streamRef - Ref to the active MediaStream (updatable on frozen-frame reinit)
 * @param {React.MutableRefObject} stateRef - Ref containing { goal: string, context: string[] }
 *                                           Use a ref (not state) so the interval always reads
 *                                           fresh values without needing to restart the loop.
 * @param {object} callbacks
 * @param {function} callbacks.onSpeak          - Called with spoken text string (updates StatusDisplay)
 * @param {function} callbacks.onContextUpdate  - Called with (navigation_direction, frame) on a spoken direction
 * @param {function} callbacks.onFrameCaptured  - Called with the captured frame after each scan-phase leg
 *                                           (win or lose), and additionally on every captured frame during
 *                                           explore/navigate phases (regardless of whether that frame's
 *                                           analysis is later accepted, stale, or turned-away) so the
 *                                           on-screen preview never freezes while guidance is withheld.
 * @param {function} callbacks.onArrival        - Called when goal is confirmed reached
 * @param {function} callbacks.onGiveUp         - Called when explore phase times out without finding the goal
 * @param {function} callbacks.onError          - Called with error string on API failure
