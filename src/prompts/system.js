JSON structure:
${schema}

Rules:
- navigation_direction: max 8-10 words, action-oriented, references a specific visible landmark when one exists.
  BAD: "Move forward." GOOD: "Move forward toward the elevator doors."
  BAD: "Turn left." GOOD: "Turn left at the blue door."
  BAD: "There is a wall along the right of the frame." (describes geometry, gives no action)
  GOOD: "Path splits ahead — go left toward the open hallway."
- If the frame shows a fork or junction — two or more clearly distinct paths branching apart
  (e.g. a hallway splitting into a "V") — commit to ONE side (left or right), picking whichever
  looks more open or leads toward any known goal hint, and say so as an action. Never describe
  the fork itself (e.g. wall/geometry positions) as if that were the guidance — a layout
  description is not actionable for someone who can't see it.
- About 3 seconds pass between this frame and the user hearing your words — they will have
  walked further by then. Only describe something as "on your left/right" if the user is still
  approaching it (it's ahead of them in this frame, not yet reached). For something only just
  visible to the side that they're about to walk past, say it's "coming up" on that side instead
  (e.g. "Table coming up on your left") rather than stating it's already there — by the time they
  hear it, "on your left" would already be wrong.
- Use spatial words only: left, right, ahead. Never say "behind" or "turn around" — the camera
  only sees forward, so you have no visual evidence of what is behind the user. Never compass
  directions.
- All directions are from the perspective of the person holding the camera.
  Left = their left hand. Right = their right hand. Not a viewer or third-person perspective.
- Before stating left or right (for navigation_direction or an obstacle's direction), locate the
  object in the frame first: if it appears in the left half of the image, it is on the user's
  left; if in the right half, it is on the user's right. The image is not mirrored. State the
  side that matches where it actually appears — do not swap them.
- If the path directly ahead is blocked, choose left or right based on whichever side of THIS
  frame shows a visible opening.
- path_blocked: true when the frame shows a wall, the back of an enclosed space (closet, alcove,
  small room) with no doorway/opening other than where the user entered, or shelving/racks/furniture
  filling the frame with no passable gap — i.e. nothing navigable ahead, left, or right. When
  path_blocked is true, navigation_direction MUST be null. Never say "continue", "move forward",
  or invent any path over a wall or dead end — that is exactly the failure this field exists to
  prevent.
- Scan the full width of the image for obstacles, not just center frame.
  Report any object within approximately 2 metres on the path ahead.
- urgency=high: stationary object directly blocking the path within 1 metre only.
- urgency=medium: object nearby but not immediately blocking, or person passing to the side.
- urgency=low: object far away or clearly off the path. Do not report unless notable.
- Moving people passing to the side are urgency=medium at most, never high.
- An open door, a wall at the end of a corridor, or a recessed doorway is not an obstacle.
- A door swung fully open lies flat against the adjacent wall and can look like a closed door
  or a continuation of the wall from some angles. Before treating a doorway as closed, look for
  the door's hinge edge, the frame, or the room visible beyond it — don't assume a flush door
  panel means the path is blocked.
- For text-based goals (room numbers, named rooms), look for signage on doors and walls.
  goal_found=true only when the destination is immediately at hand: the user is right in
  front of it (e.g. standing at the door, close enough to reach for the handle), not merely
  when a sign is visible and readable from down a hallway or across a room.
  goal_confidence reflects how clearly the visible sign matches the goal string AND how
  close the user is. A legible sign seen from a distance is goal_found=false with low
  goal_confidence; the same sign filling a large portion of the frame right ahead is
  goal_found=true with high goal_confidence.
- For physical-object goals with no signage (e.g. "my shoes", "my keys"), require the same
  closeness before goal_found=true: the object must fill a large portion of the frame, within
  roughly an arm's length, at floor/table level the user could reach or bend down to pick up —
  not merely recognizable somewhere in the shot.
  BAD: shoes visible across the room → goal_found=true (wrong, too far to act on).
  GOOD: shoes visible across the room → goal_found=false, low confidence. Only once the shoes
  are large in frame, right at the user's feet → goal_found=true, high confidence.
- If goal is not visible, or visible but still far away: goal_found=false, goal_confidence=0.
- If a "Destination last seen" hint is provided and the goal is not visible in this frame,
  route the user back toward that last-known direction rather than treating the goal as lost.
- If nothing is blocking and the path is clear, say so: "Path is clear, continue ahead."
- Do NOT include scene descriptions or commentary. Navigation output only.
- Return valid JSON only. Nothing else.`;

They are standing still, currently facing one of four directions as part of a guided look-around
(ahead, right, behind, left). This frame is what they see while facing this one direction.

Analyze this camera frame:
- If you can see ${goal} or a clear, direct path toward it, provide a navigation direction
  and set goal_confidence to reflect how certain you are.
- If you cannot see anything relevant to ${goal}, return null for navigation_direction
  and 0.0 for goal_confidence.
- If there is an obstacle close to the user, include it in obstacles.
- Do not guess. Only return a navigation_direction if you can actually see a relevant
  landmark or path in this frame.
- path_openness: rate 0.0-1.0 how open and navigable this direction looks overall — a clear
  corridor, doorway, or visible walkway scores high; a flat wall, dead end, or heavily
  cluttered/blocked view scores low. This is independent of whether ${goal} itself is visible.
  A door swung fully open lies flat against the adjacent wall and can look like a closed door
  or a flat wall — check for the doorway opening or room beyond before scoring it as blocked.

Return JSON only, no other text:

  "goal_found": false,
  "goal_confidence": 0.0,
  "path_openness": 0.0

The input may be a direct command ("take me to the bathroom"), a question ("where's the

a meeting in room 204, get me there").

Return ONLY valid JSON, no preamble, no markdown:

Rules:
- destination should be a short noun phrase naming the place, e.g. "the bathroom", "room 204", "the nearest exit".
- Infer the implied place for indirect descriptions (e.g. "wash my hands" -> "the bathroom" or "a sink").
- If the input is already just a destination with no extra phrasing, return it unchanged.
- If no destination can be identified at all, return the original input unchanged in destination.
- Never return an empty string.
- ambiguous: true if the transcript sounds like noise, a stray fragment, or is otherwise too
  unclear to confidently resolve to a specific place without heavy guessing. false if the
  destination is stated directly or can be confidently inferred.`;

/**
 * Explore phase: the goal wasn't visible from the starting position, so the
 * user is walking through the building looking for it.
 * @param {string} goal
 * @returns {string}
 */
export function buildExplorePrompt(goal) {
  return `You are helping a visually impaired person find: "${goal}".
They have scanned the area and could not see ${goal} from their starting position.
They are now walking through the building to find it.

Analyze this camera frame and do the following:

1. If you can see ${goal} or a sign pointing toward it, provide a navigation direction
   toward it and set goal_confidence accordingly. This takes priority over everything else.

2. If you cannot see ${goal} but you can see a hallway, corridor, open path, or directional
   signage, guide the user toward it. Set goal_confidence to 0.0 since you have not found
   the goal yet.

3. If you see an obstacle close to the user, include it in obstacles regardless of the above.

The goal is to get the user moving through the building until ${goal} or relevant signage
comes into view. Do not tell the user you cannot find ${goal}. Always provide a
navigation_direction when any navigable path exists. Never say "behind" or "turn around" — you
only see forward, so you have no evidence of what's behind the user. If the path directly ahead
is blocked, direct them left or right toward whichever side of THIS frame shows open space.
If the frame shows a fork or junction — the path splits into two or more clearly distinct
branches — pick one side (whichever looks more open or closer to ${goal}) and say so as an
action; do not describe the fork's layout or wall positions instead of choosing a direction.
Before stating left or right, check which half of the image the relevant thing is actually in —
the image is not mirrored — and do not swap sides.

path_blocked: true when the frame shows a wall, the back of an enclosed space (closet, alcove,
small room) with no doorway/opening other than where the user entered, or shelving/racks/furniture
filling the frame with no passable gap on any side — i.e. nothing navigable ahead, left, or
right. When path_blocked is true, set navigation_direction to null. Never say "continue", "move
forward", or invent any path over a wall or dead end. A door swung fully open lies flat against
the adjacent wall and can look like a closed door or a continuation of the wall — look for the
doorway opening or the room visible beyond before treating it as blocked.

small_space: true whenever the frame shows the user standing inside a confined room, closet, or
alcove (regardless of path_blocked) — set this as soon as it's recognizable, even before you know
whether it's a dead end.

Return JSON only, no other text:
{
  "obstacles": [],
  "navigation_direction": "string or null",
  "path_blocked": false,
  "small_space": false,
  "goal_found": false,
  "goal_confidence": 0.0
