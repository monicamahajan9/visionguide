Analyze the image and return ONLY valid JSON. No preamble, no markdown, no explanation.

JSON structure:
${schema}

Rules:
- navigation_direction: max 15 words, action-oriented, references a specific visible landmark when one exists.
  BAD: "Move forward." GOOD: "Move forward toward the elevator doors ahead."
  BAD: "Turn left." GOOD: "Turn left at the blue door."
- Use spatial words only: left, right, ahead, behind. Never compass directions.
- All directions are from the perspective of the person holding the camera.
  Left = their left hand. Right = their right hand. Not a viewer or third-person perspective.
- Scan the full width of the image for obstacles, not just center frame.
  Report any object within approximately 2 metres on the path ahead.
- urgency=high: stationary object directly blocking the path within 1 metre only.
- urgency=medium: object nearby but not immediately blocking, or person passing to the side.
- urgency=low: object far away or clearly off the path. Do not report unless notable.
- Moving people passing to the side are urgency=medium at most, never high.
- An open door, a wall at the end of a corridor, or a recessed doorway is not an obstacle.
- For text-based goals (room numbers, named rooms), look for signage on doors and walls.
  goal_found=true only when the destination is immediately at hand: the user is right in
  front of it (e.g. standing at the door, close enough to reach for the handle), not merely
  when a sign is visible and readable from down a hallway or across a room.
  goal_confidence reflects how clearly the visible sign matches the goal string AND how
  close the user is. A legible sign seen from a distance is goal_found=false with low
  goal_confidence; the same sign filling a large portion of the frame right ahead is
  goal_found=true with high goal_confidence.
- If goal is not visible, or visible but still far away: goal_found=false, goal_confidence=0.
- If nothing is blocking and the path is clear, say so: "Path is clear, continue ahead."
- Do NOT include scene descriptions or commentary. Navigation output only.
- Return valid JSON only. Nothing else.`;

export function buildScanPrompt(goal) {
  return `You are helping a visually impaired person find: "${goal}".
They are standing still and slowly rotating their phone to scan the room.

Analyze this camera frame:
- If you can see ${goal} or a clear, direct path toward it, provide a navigation direction
  and set goal_confidence to reflect how certain you are.
- If you cannot see anything relevant to ${goal}, return null for navigation_direction
  and 0.0 for goal_confidence.
- If there is an obstacle close to the user, include it in obstacles.
- Do not guess. Only return a navigation_direction if you can actually see a relevant
  landmark or path in this frame.

  "goal_found": false,

 */
export function buildExplorePrompt(goal) {
  return `You are helping a visually impaired person find: "${goal}".
They have scanned the area and could not see ${goal} from their starting position.
They are now walking through the building to find it.

Analyze this camera frame and do the following:

1. If you can see ${goal} or a sign pointing toward it, provide a navigation direction
   toward it and set goal_confidence accordingly. This takes priority over everything else.

2. If you cannot see ${goal} but you can see a hallway, corridor, open path, or directional
   signage, guide the user toward it. Set goal_confidence to 0.0 since you have not found
   the goal yet.

3. If you see an obstacle close to the user, include it in obstacles regardless of the above.

The goal is to get the user moving through the building until ${goal} or relevant signage
comes into view. Do not tell the user you cannot find ${goal}. Always provide a
navigation_direction unless the path is completely blocked.

Return JSON only, no other text:
{
  "obstacles": [],
  "navigation_direction": "string or null",
  "goal_found": false,
  "goal_confidence": 0.0
}`;
